This small program dubbed "Season Renamer" allows you to quickly rename large batches of files in a numbered sequence. It was originally developed to speed up the process of renaming seasons of TV shows to a friendlier reading format.

It supports several operations that are useful for this:

Numbering mask:
	The numbering mask is useful for naming sequences. For example, a mask of "S01E## - " would yield filenames such as this...
		S01E01 - Pilot.avi
		S01E02 - Beginnings.avi
		S01E03 - Fun in the sun.avi
		etc...

Title cropping:
	If filenames are very close to the titles you want, but have annoying prefixes or suffixes, you may crop titles from filenames by trimming of X number of characters.
	
	For example, file names like this...
		FUN - 1x01 - GREAT STUFF.avi
		FUN - 1x02 - SUPER STUFF.avi
		FUN - 1x03 - AWESOME STUFF.avi
		
	Could be cropped to produce results like this:
		GREAT STUFF
		SUPER STUFF
		AWESOME STUFF

Adding/editing/deleting and find/replacing titles:
	You may manually add titles to the list by typing them in and clicking "Add Title". You may also do a mass replace on all titles to replace or fix titles with prefixes, suffixes, or other anomalies.

Clipboard capture:
	This is a powerful feature that allows you to quickly populate nice, clean titles from an alternate source, such as Wikipedia. Simply turn on clipboard capture, and start copying titles. They will be added to the list as they appear.

FINALLY...
	When you are ready to perform the rename, you will be given a quick summary of the files that will be changed. Once you proceed, they will be renamed. Woot!
